"""
alerts.py — secure-by-design detection for cybergod.ai. Sliding-window rules -> Telegram + email.

DESIGN NOTES
* In-process, in-memory windows. Deliberate: colt-web is ONE container, alerts must fire in
  milliseconds, and a detection stack that needs its own database is a stack that rots. Loki keeps
  the forensic history; this only keeps the last hour to make a decision.
* Every rule is rate-limited by a COOLDOWN and a global storm cap. An alert system that pages you 400
  times during a DDoS is a second outage — you would mute it, and then miss the real one.
* Alerting NEVER blocks or breaks a request. Detection only. Blocking belongs in Caddy/the firewall,
  and we do not touch the firewall (Amnezia VPN shares this host).
* Thresholds are env-tunable. Defaults are for a low-traffic internal tool: a burst that is normal on
  a public site is genuinely suspicious here.
